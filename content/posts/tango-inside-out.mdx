How we approach and teach tango and contemporary dance can be broadly classified into two distinctive methods. Tango traditionally starts from the outside, emphasising learning the basic steps and rhythms before delving into the inner aspects of the dance, such as personal expression and emotion. In contrast, contemporary dance takes an "inside out" approach, seeking to uncover internal motivations and then giving them form through various improvisational techniques before refining them into a more structured dance.

While both approaches have their merits, we firmly believe that the "inside out" approach, as seen in contemporary dance, holds the key to enhancing the social dance experience, particularly in the case of tango.

Firstly, the "inside out" approach strongly emphasises individuality and personal expression. It recognises that each dancer brings unique emotions, experiences, and motivations to the dance floor. By starting from the inside, we tap into this well of personal creativity, allowing dancers to express themselves authentically through movement. This approach enriches the dancer's experience and adds depth and nuance to the dance itself.

Secondly, the "inside out" approach fosters a deeper connection between dancers. In tango, communication is fundamental, and connecting with a partner on an emotional level dramatically enhances the dance. We create a more profound connection between partners by encouraging dancers to explore their inner motivations and emotions. This, in turn, leads to a richer and more engaging social dance experience.

Furthermore, introducing the "inside out" approach to tango can revitalise the dance form and attract a new generation of enthusiasts. It offers a fresh perspective on a traditional art form, making it more accessible and appealing to those who might otherwise find tango intimidating. By emphasising personal expression and creativity, we make tango more inclusive and relatable to a broader audience.

In conclusion, the "inside out" approach, as exemplified in contemporary dance, can transform how we teach and experience tango. By encouraging dancers to explore their inner motivations and express themselves authentically, we can elevate the social dance experience, fostering deeper connections and attracting a broader range of enthusiasts. It's time to bring this innovative approach to tango and unlock its full potential as a social dance form.
