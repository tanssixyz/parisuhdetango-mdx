In Improtango, touch plays a vital role in communication. It goes beyond physical contact; it becomes a language through which dancers can convey emotions, intentions, and connection.

By actively sensitising ourselves to touch, we develop a heightened awareness of the subtle messages and impulses that can be shared through this intimate connection. Touch allows us to listen and transmit these messages with clarity, making our communication more effective and profound.

In Improtango, touch is not meant to be coercive or forceful. Instead, it acts as a gentle suggestion, inviting our partner to join us on a journey of movement and expression. Through this non-verbal interaction, we develop a deeper understanding of each other's needs, nuances, and desires.

The dynamic energy shared between two dance partners is transmitted through touch in a flowing and alternating manner. It creates a continuous exchange, like a conversation between bodies, where one partner responds to what is happening in the moment, rather than relying on what they think may be happening.

Through touch, dancers establish a deep level of trust, vulnerability, and connection. They learn to rely on their instincts and intuition, allowing their bodies to effortlessly communicate and flow together. It is through touch that dancers find the freedom to explore and express themselves authentically, creating a powerful dance experience.

In summary, touch is an essential aspect of Improtango. It enables the transmission of messages and impulses, deepens connection and trust, and allows for an intuitive and profound dance experience. By embracing touch, dancers can communicate with their partners in a way that goes beyond words, creating beauty, emotion, and connection in the dance
